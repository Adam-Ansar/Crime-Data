    "# Analysis of Gun-Related Suicides in the United States\n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "Gun-related suicides represent a significant portion of firearm-related deaths in the United States, posing a critical public health challenge. Understanding the factors contributing to these tragic events is essential for developing effective prevention strategies. This notebook aims to analyze gun-related suicides using a comprehensive dataset to uncover patterns, trends, and potential risk factors associated with these incidents. By conducting a thorough analysis, we hope to provide insights that can inform policy decisions, public health interventions, and further research.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Hypotheses\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Hypothesis 1**: Suicide rates are higher for individuals with lower education levels.\n",
    "    \n",
    "2. **Hypothesis 2**: Gun-related suicides peak in winter months.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Hypothesis 3:** Gun-related suicide tends to increase as age increases.\n",
    "   \n",
    "\n",
    "### Dataset Description\n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset used in this analysis contains detailed information on gun-related deaths in the United States. The variables include:\n",
    "- **Year**: The year in which the death occurred.\n",
    "- **Month**: The month in which the death occurred.\n",
    "- **Intent**: The intent of the death (e.g., Suicide, Homicide, Accidental).\n",
    "- **Police**: Whether a police officer was involved in the death.\n",
    "- **Sex**: The gender of the deceased.\n",
    "- **Age**: The age of the deceased.\n",
    "- **Race**: The race of the deceased.\n",
    "- **Place**: The location where the death occurred.\n",
    "- **Education**: The education level of the deceased.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Ethical Considerations\n",
    "\n",
    "Given the sensitive nature of the data, it is crucial to handle it with care and ensure that all analyses are conducted ethically. This includes:\n",
    "- **Privacy and Confidentiality**: Ensuring that the data is anonymized and does not contain any personally identifiable information (PII).\n",
    "- **Data Accuracy and Integrity**: Ensuring the accuracy and integrity of the data to avoid misleading conclusions.\n",
    "- **Bias and Fairness**: Recognizing and addressing any potential biases in the dataset to ensure a fair analysis.\n",
    "- **Ethical Reporting**: Presenting the findings transparently and avoiding any manipulation of data to support a particular hypothesis.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Structure of the Notebook\n",
    "\n",
    "The notebook is structured into several sections, each focusing on a specific aspect of the analysis:\n",
    "1. **Data Loading and Exploration**: Importing the dataset and performing initial exploration.\n",
    "2. **Data Cleaning and Refinement**: Cleaning the data to ensure accuracy and reliability.\n",
    "3. **Preliminary Analysis and Visualizations**: Conducting surface-level analysis and creating visualizations.\n",
    "4. **Hypothesis Testing**: Formulating and testing hypotheses related to gun-related suicides.\n",
    "5. **Conclusions and Policy Recommendations**: Summarizing the findings and providing policy recommendations based on the analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "By following this structured approach, we aim to provide a comprehensive analysis of gun-related suicides in the United States, uncovering key insights and contributing to the ongoing efforts to address this critical public health issue.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Streamlit Dashboard\n",
    "\n",
    "To make the analysis interactive and accessible, we have also created a Streamlit dashboard. The dashboard allows users to explore the data, visualize trends, and interact with the findings in real-time.\n"

It is crucial to ensure that the data is anonymized and does not contain any personally identifiable information (PII). In this dataset, all personal identifiers have been removed, and only aggregated data is used for analysis.\n",

    "\n",
    "This analysis tested whether there is a seasonal pattern to gun-related suicides, specifically investigating if suicide rates peak during winter months (December, January, and February). The hypothesis was based on existing research suggesting that seasonal affective disorder (SAD) and winter depression might contribute to increased suicide rates during colder, darker months.\n",
    "\n",
    "The methodology included:\n",
    "- Comparing suicide counts between winter months (December, January, February) and non-winter months\n",
    "- Adjusting for different number of days in each month to enable accurate comparison\n",
    "- Calculating daily average suicide rates by season\n",
    "- Statistical testing using both chi-square test and t-test to determine significance\n",
    "- Visualization of monthly and seasonal patterns through bar charts and line plots\n",
    "\n",
    "The analysis incorporated proper corrections for varying month lengths, ensuring that the comparison between seasons was fair. Monthly suicide counts were normalized to daily averages to account for this variation.\n",
    "\n",
    "Multiple statistical tests were employed to verify the findings, with attention given to both statistical significance and practical implications. Detailed visualizations were created to illustrate monthly and seasonal patterns, with attention to daily averages rather than raw counts to prevent misinterpretation.\n",

    "This analysis helps inform whether suicide prevention efforts should target specific seasons or maintain consistent interventions throughout the year.\n",

The chi-square statistic was 896.9539 with a p-value of 1.2459e-180, which is much smaller than the significance level (alpha = 0.05). Therefore, we reject the null hypothesis, suggesting that there is a significant difference in suicide rates across age groups.

    "\n",
    "2. **Hypothesis 2: Gun-related suicides peak in winter months.**\n",

    "\n",
    "3. **Hypothesis 3: Gun-related suicide tends to increase as age increases.**\n",

    "A number of policy suggestions can be made to address the issues found in the analysis of gun-related suicides. First off, the strong link between higher suicide rates and lower educational attainment points to the necessity of focused educational initiatives and mental health support in communities with lower educational attainment. The risk factors linked to lower educational attainment could be reduced by putting in place mental health awareness campaigns and offering easily accessible mental health services in community centres and schools. Suicide rates may also be lowered in the long run by policies that enhance socioeconomic conditions and educational opportunities in underprivileged areas.\n",
    "\n",
    "Additionally, there was no discernible seasonal variation in gun-related suicides, according to the analysis, suggesting that year-round interventions are preferable to those that only target particular seasons. But For those with seasonal affective disorder (SAD) and other seasonal mental health conditions, ongoing support is still crucial. People can seek help sooner if mental health services are made available all year round and if people are made aware of the symptoms and indicators of SAD.\n",
    "\n",
    "Addressing mental health concerns among older adults is crucial, as evidenced by the finding that suicide rates tend to rise with age. In order to combat loneliness and isolation, policies should prioritise providing senior citizens with mental health resources and support, such as counselling services, social support programs, and routine mental health screenings. Additionally, early intervention and treatment outcomes can be enhanced by educating healthcare professionals on how to identify and treat mental health concerns in older adults.\n",
    "\n",
    "The root causes of the trends in gun-related suicides should be investigated in future studies. Examining the precise causes of the higher suicide rates among older adults and those with less education can yield important information for creating focused interventions. The effectiveness of policy changes over time may be evaluated with the aid of longitudinal studies that look at how socioeconomic and educational advancements affect suicide rates. Furthermore, more thorough and inclusive policy approaches can be informed by research on how cultural, social, and economic factors affect suicide rates across various demographic groups."
